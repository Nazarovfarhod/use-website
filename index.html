    <b>The United States of America</b> (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America, between Canada and Mexico. It is a liberal democracy and republic of 50 federated states, a federal capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations that overlap with state boundaries. Outside the union of states, it asserts sovereignty over five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands. The country has the world's third-largest land area, largest maritime exclusive economic zone, and the third-largest population (over 334 million). The federal government uses a presidential system with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial.

    American territory was first settled by Paleo-Indians who migrated across the Bering land bridge over 12,000 years ago. Colonization by the British began in 1607. Thirteen colonies eventually rebelled against the British Crown over taxation and political representation, declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Their victory in the American Revolutionary War (1775–83) resulted in a confederation of states before the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights were ratified. The young nation continued to acquire neighboring territories and spanned North America by the late 1840s. Longstanding disagreements over slavery led to the secession of the southern Confederate States of America, which were defeated by the remaining Union in the American Civil War (1861–65). Slavery was abolished, but discriminatory laws persisted in the South. By 1900, rapid industrialization established the United States as a great power and the world's largest economy. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States joined the Allies of World War II. After their victory, it competed against the Soviet Union for dominance in nuclear and conventional weaponry, ideology, and international influence during the Space Race and Cold War. Many racist practices in the country were overturned in the 1960s, and U.S. astronauts became the first humans to land on the Moon (1969). The nation emerged as the world's sole superpower after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991).

      The United States accounts for about 25% of the global economy and 30% of global wealth. It has the world's largest nominal GDP and ranks high in measures of income, wealth, economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. The country is home to globally important industries in aerospace and defense, automobiles, energy, entertainment, finance, healthcare, and information technology. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of American States, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

       <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; the Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas. Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies. Indigenous peoples and cultures such as the Algonquian peoples,[32] Ancestral Puebloans, and the Iroquois developed across the present-day United States. Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000 to nearly 10 million.

      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p>Main articles: Geography of the United States and Borders of the United States</p>
      <p>
        The United States is the world's third-largest country by land and total area behind Russia and Canada. The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[158][159] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California, about 84 miles (135 km) apart. At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. In 2021 the United States had 8% of global permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of cropland.

      <h3>Climate</h3>
      <p>Main articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States</p>
       <p>
        With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.
      </p>
         <p>

          States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley. Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country. Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.

         <h4>Learn how the Star-Spangled Banner became America's national anthem.</h4>
         <p>
          The Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem of the United States.
         </p>
          <P>
            To celebrate their victory over British forces during the War of 1812, U.S. soldiers raised a large American flag at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 14, 1814.
          </P>

            <P>
              Poet Francis Scott Key was inspired by seeing the flag after witnessing the fort’s bombardment. He wrote a poem called "Defence of Fort M'Henry." This eventually became the Star-Spangled Banner and the United States national anthem.

            <h2 class="main-anthem"><strong>The Star-Spangled Banner</strong><br></h2>
            <p class="anthem">
              O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br>
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight <br>
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming? <br>
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, <br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, <br>
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave <br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? <br>
<br><br>
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep <br>
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br>
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, <br>
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? <br>
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, <br>
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream, <br>
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave <br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! <br>
<br><br>
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, <br>
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion <br>
A home and a Country should leave us no more? <br>
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution. <br>
No refuge could save the hireling and slave <br>
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,  <br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave <br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. <br>
<br><br>
O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand <br>
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation! <br>
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land <br>
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation! <br>
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, <br>
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” <br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave <br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              This 19th century version (MP3) of the Star-Spangled Banner was performed on original instruments from the National Museum of American History's collection. Arranged by G. W. E. Friederich, the music is played as it would have been heard in 1854.
